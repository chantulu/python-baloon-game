# python-baloon-game

This repository contains a simple physics project that allows you to play a balloon shooting game. The game starts by placing a starting point for a rock or object, and random balloons appear on the screen. Your objective is to shoot the balloons by clicking a button. If you hit a balloon, it will disappear.
